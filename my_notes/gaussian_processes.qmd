## Intro

- A Gaussian Process is a collection of random variables over a space such that any finite subset is also Gaussian.

$$
f(\mathbf{x}) \sim \mathcal{GP}(\mu(\mathbf{x}),\kappa (\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}'))
$$

- GPs are **non-parametric**

## Use cases

- The kernel representation (covariance function) encodes prior beliefs in the data-generating latent functions. 
- Covariance functions typically involve parameters that are learned from the data.

## Setup

$$
f(t) \sim \mathcal{GP}(..) \ \ \ \text{prior} 
\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{f} \sim \prod_i p(y_i|f(x_i)) \ \ \ \text{likelihood}
$$

## Problems

- Does not scale well to large data sets beyond $n>10000$.
- Time series works really well ($\mathcal{GP}-VAR$)?
